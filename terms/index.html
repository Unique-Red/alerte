For example, Apple App Store’s rules and/or policies or Google Play’s rules and/or policies. You must comply with the App Store’s rules as well as this agreement but if there are any differences between these terms and the third party’s rules and policies, you should follow third party’s rules and policies instead of these terms.</p>

</div>

<button class="accordion">Location Data
    <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>The App and the Services makes use of functionality on your device that can pinpoint your location. We do this in order for users to share their locations with each other for tracking and monitoring purposes.
        <br>
        When you open the App for the first time, you will be asked whether the App and the Services can use your location and in what circumstances.
        <br>
        You can change your choices at any time in the App settings, and you can also turn the location services off at any time. The App and the Services will still function if location services are off, but its functionality may be reduced.
        <br>
        Please refer to our privacy policy for further information.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Update to the App and changes to the Service
    <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>From time to time we may automatically update the App and change the Service to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively we may ask you to update the App for these reasons.
        <br>
        If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App and the Services.
        <br>
        The App will always work with the current version of the operating system (as it may be updated from time to time) and match the description of it provided to you when you bought it.
        <br>
        If you download or stream the App onto any phone or other device not owned by you, you must have the owner's permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the phone or other device.</p>

        Payment terms
        <br>
        All payments will be based on subscription fees payable by you to Alerte for the App and the Services (“Subscription Fees”).
        The Subscription Fees shall be based on an annual or monthly basis (which may be subject to applicable discounts depending on the number of users and duration). Details of the Subscription Fees (and any applicable discounts) can be found on the App or at https://alerteuniversal.com. When creating an account on the App, you will be required to select a subscription package (which will either be a monthly or annual subscription) (“Subscription Package”). The subscription will automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis, depending on which Subscription Package you select (however, please see below for information on how you can cancel your subscription).
        <br>
        You shall pay the Subscription Fees to Alerte in accordance with these terms and conditions and the relevant Subscription Package.
        <br>
        The first date of payment will be the date at which you register/create an account on the App (“Effective Date”). You shall on the Effective Date provide to Alerte up-to-date and complete credit or debit card details acceptable to Alerte. Subsequent payments will be automatically taken on each anniversary of the Effective Date (for example, if you have subscribed for a monthly subscription and the first payment was made on the 1st day of the month, all subsequent payments shall be made on the 1st of every month thereafter).
        <br>
        You authorise Alerte to bill such credit or debit card in respect of the Subscription Fees. If Alerte does not receive payment on the Effective Date, then Alerte may disable your account and access to the App until payment is confirmed.
        If your primary method of payment cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), we will contact you via email, SMS or via the App, to inform you of a failed payment. Until payment has been made, Alerte may disable your access to the App.
        <br>
        Alerte accepts the following credit cards and debit cards: [Visa, Mastercard]
        All payments shall be in pounds sterling (£)(GBP).
        You may cancel your subscription by contacting help@alerteuniversal.com or by updating your account details via the App, at which point, your subscription will terminate at the end of the relevant month. You may also contact us to receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.
        <br>
        Alerte shall be entitled to increase the Subscription Fees at any time by giving 30 days written notice to you either by SMS, email or by notifying you the next time you access the App. If you do not agree to the increase in Subscription Fees, you can cancel your subscription at any time.
        <br>
        Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you
        We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill , but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these terms, both we and you knew it might happen.
        <br>
        We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
        <br>
        When we are liable for damage to your property. If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.
        <br>
        We are not liable for business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
        <br>
        Limitations to the App and the Services. The App and the Services are provided for general information only. They do not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App or the Service. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the Service, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.
        <br>

        <br>
        Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you. The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as described on the Appstore site) meet your requirements.
        <br>
        We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.
        <br>
        Failures of networks or hardware. The App relies on a number of things working properly to enable you to enjoy all of its features. Many of these, such as your internet connection, your device and the app store, are entirely outside of our control. Although we will do everything we reasonably can to resolve issues, we are not responsible to you if you are unable to use all or any part of the App due to a poor internet connection, faulty components in your device (such as a faulty camera), app store failure or anything else that it would not be reasonable to expect us to control.
        <br>
        We may end your rights to use the App and the Services if you break these terms
        We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.
        <br>
        If we end your rights to use the App and Services:
        <br>
        ●        you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services;
        <br>
        ●        you must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this;
        <br>
        ●        we may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them and cease providing you with access to the Services; and
        <br>
        ●        where your right to use the App or Services has been ended because you have not complied with these terms, you are not entitled to a refund.
        We may transfer this agreement to someone else
        We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
        <br>
        You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else
        You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.
        <br>
        No rights for third parties
        <br>
        This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.
        <br>
        If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force
        Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
        <br>
        Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later
        Even if we delay in enforcing this agreement, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this agreement, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
        <br>
        Which laws apply to this agreement and where you may bring legal proceedings
        These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.
        <br>
        Alternative dispute resolution
        <br>
        We have a complaints procedure which you can access if you have any issue with the supply of the App and/or the Services – please contact us to discuss a complaint in the first instance. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can contact Citizens Advice or seek alternative dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not satisfied with the outcome you can still bring legal proceedings.
