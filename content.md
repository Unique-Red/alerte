How Alerte Works
	The application would be available online for users to download.
	Once the user download the application and clicks install, a page would appear which would let the user read the terms and conditions of the application and upon agreement it can be installed on their device successfully.
	On opening the application after a successful installation, the first page the user sees would be a bio-data (about the user) form page. This page would involve the user to enter his personal information. This is a one of process. This page would not be visible when the user opens the application afterwards.
	Once the bio-data page has successfully been filled without errors. ALERTE APPLICATION is ready to go to work.
	The main ALERTE page would enable users utilize the application to its full potential. This page comes in two (2) phase. The first phase would enable users sent an instant ALERT of a situation just by the press of a button while the second phase would be like a text message the user sends via the application. The first phase is for user who are in desperate situations and don’t have the timing to give a detailed description about that particular situation, for example, arising situations like being in the middle of an arm robbery operation, fire trapped etc. The second phase would be for users who have the timing to give a detailed description of the situation on ground, so that the response unit (agencies) would know what they are about to face.
	Once this alert is sent, agencies which would be connected to the application would receive it and go into action.
	You might be asking, how would agencies be connected to the application know where the alert is coming from? This is where network providers come in. Your devices use the services of a particular network provider e.g. MTN, AIRTEL, Glo, etc. The alert would also show the location of that particular device the user used. 
	The agencies receiving this alert would have a backend for the alert to come in from. So the front end is for the user to send the alert while the backend is for the agencies to receive the alert.
	The alert might require the use of the user mobile data or credit.
	There would be other pages in the application. Pages like About ALERTE, How it works etc.
	The user would have certain privileges. For example, privileges like editing their profile.
	The user bio-data would be stored in a secured database. This bio-data is used for reference purposes.


NOTE: ALERTE APPLICATION can’t work by itself; it would involve the combine effort of USERS, NETWORK PROVIDERS & AGENCIES. 

USER – The user would be the common man.
NETWORK PROVIDERS – MTN, AIRTEL, ETISALAT etc.
AGENCIES – The agencies could be law enforcement agencies, medical agencies etc.

This is a basic write-up of how ALERTE APPLICATION would work and not the final because ideas grow.

How Alerte Works
Quick Alerts, Fast Responses – Alerte is designed to connect you to help in emergency situations within seconds. Here's how it works:
1. Download and Install
Alerte is available for download across multiple platforms. Once you've downloaded the app, installation is easy. You'll be prompted to read and agree to our Terms and Conditions before proceeding. After agreement, Alerte will install and be ready to use.
2. Bio-Data Setup
The first time you open the app, you'll need to complete a one-time setup by providing some basic personal information. This is required to help responders identify and locate you during emergencies. Once your details are submitted, you won't have to enter them again.
3. Two Ways to Send Alerts
•	Instant Alert (One-Click SOS)
In critical situations where every second counts (e.g., a fire outbreak, armed robbery, or medical emergency), simply press the emergency button. This sends an instant SOS alert to the connected agencies without the need to describe the situation.
•	Detailed Alert
If you have more time or need to give extra details (e.g., a collapsed building, road accident), you can use the detailed alert option. This allows you to describe the situation, giving responders more context to act on.
4. Location Sharing
When you send an alert, Alerte uses your phone's location to pinpoint your exact position. Your network provider (e.g., MTN, Airtel, Glo, etc.) helps share this location data with the relevant authorities. This ensures help arrives at the right place, fast.
5. Agencies Respond in Real-Time
All alerts are sent to the backend system used by the emergency agencies. This system allows them to receive your information and quickly dispatch help. Rest assured, Alerte connects you directly to the agencies that can provide the support you need.
6. Mobile Data or Credit Usage
Depending on the situation, Alerte might require mobile data or credit to send your alerts. Make sure you’re connected to ensure your alert is transmitted smoothly.
